# TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PROJECT
The project predicts whether the passenger in Titanic survived or not. For this, we firstly cleaned the dataset, the converted the data to categorical data to perform evaluation, then build our model and cross validate it.

DATASET is being embeded with the pynb file.
WE also did analysis of data and visualise it using various graphs.
